My personal portfolio website

This is my first programming project which doubles as my personal online portfolio and my foundational self-introduction to learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript. 

As an instructional project, there are several goals to achieve:
1. Create project using vanilla html, css, and javascript
2. Implement a new project within the website using back-end code (Secret projects)
3. Design desktop and mobile websites seperately to feel as a single project but unique to their interactive natures
